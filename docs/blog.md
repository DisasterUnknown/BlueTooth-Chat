*Published: January 2025*

In an increasingly connected world, what happens when connectivity fails? This article explores the development of a **fully offline Bluetooth mesh network chat application** built with Flutter, examining the technologies used, potential real-world applications, and the inherent trade-offs of such a system.

## Technology Stack

### Core Framework: Flutter & Dart

**Flutter 3.9.2+** serves as the primary framework, chosen for its:
- **Cross-platform capabilities**: Single codebase for Android, iOS, and potentially desktop platforms
- **Performance**: Native compilation and efficient rendering engine
- **Rich ecosystem**: Extensive package ecosystem via pub.dev
- **Hot reload**: Rapid development and iteration

**Dart** as the programming language provides:
- Strong typing with type inference
- Async/await for handling asynchronous operations
- Stream-based reactive programming
- Excellent tooling and IDE support

### Bluetooth Communication Layer

#### 1. **Nearby Connections API** (`nearby_connections: ^4.3.0`)
- **Purpose**: Android's peer-to-peer communication framework
- **Strategy**: Uses `P2P_CLUSTER` for mesh networking
- **Features**:
  - Automatic peer discovery
  - Connection management
  - Reliable message delivery
  - Bandwidth-efficient data transfer

#### 2. **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**
- **flutter_blue_plus**: ^1.34.5 - BLE scanning and connection management
- **ble_peripheral**: ^2.4.0 - Peripheral mode support
- **flutter_ble_peripheral**: ^2.0.1 - Additional peripheral functionality

**Why BLE?**
- Lower power consumption compared to classic Bluetooth
- Better range and reliability
- Supported by modern Android devices
- Enables long-running mesh networks without excessive battery drain

### Mesh Networking Protocol: Gossip Protocol

The application implements a **probabilistic gossip protocol** for message propagation:

#### Key Components:
- **Fanout Limiting**: Messages are gossiped to only 3 randomly selected peers (configurable)
- **Weighted Peer Selection**: Peers are selected based on:
  - Battery level (high battery = 2x weight, low = 0.5x weight)
  - Signal strength (strong = 1.3x weight, weak = 0.7x weight)
- **Store-and-Carry Pattern**: Messages are stored locally and forwarded when new peers connect
- **TTL Management**: Messages expire after 24 hours to prevent infinite propagation
- **Hop Count Limiting**: Maximum 10 hops to prevent network flooding

#### Implementation Details:
- **Batched Processing**: Messages are queued and processed every 30 seconds
- **Urgent Message Handling**: Chat messages bypass batching for immediate propagation
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Uses Bloom filters and seen message tracking

### Data Persistence: SQLite

**sqflite: ^2.4.2** provides local database storage:

#### Database Schema:
- `users`: User information and metadata
- `nonUserMsgs`: Pending messages awaiting delivery
- `hashMsgs`: Seen message tracking for duplicate prevention
- `incident_reports_incoming/outgoing`: Incident report management
- Encrypted chat message tables

**Why SQLite?**
- Zero-configuration database
- Lightweight and efficient
- ACID compliance for data integrity
- Excellent for offline-first applications

### Security & Encryption

#### 1. **End-to-End Encryption** (`encrypt: ^5.0.3`)
- **Algorithm**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- **Key Derivation**: Keys derived from recipient's user code
- **IV Management**: Unique initialization vectors per message
- **Storage**: Encrypted messages stored in database

#### 2. **Cryptographic Utilities** (`crypto: ^3.0.7`)
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: For message integrity checks
- **Checksum Generation**: Data integrity verification
- **UUID Generation**: Unique message and peer identification

#### 3. **Secure Storage** (`flutter_secure_storage: ^10.0.0`)
- Device-specific secure key storage
- Encrypted shared preferences
- Protection against unauthorized access

### Additional Technologies

#### State Management & UI
- **Material Design**: Flutter's built-in Material components
- **Stream-based Architecture**: Reactive data flow using Dart streams
- **Custom Logging System**: Real-time log viewing and filtering

#### Utilities
- **permission_handler: ^12.0.1**: Runtime permission management
- **shared_preferences: ^2.5.4**: Simple key-value storage
- **path_provider: ^2.1.5**: File system path management
- **uuid: ^4.5.2**: Unique identifier generation
- **connectivity_plus: ^7.0.0**: Network state monitoring
